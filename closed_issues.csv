Every evening around 11 pm, multiple cars park in a NO PARKING ZONE on Atwater behind Joe Louis Arena at the end of the Riverwalk near the pyramid. They play loud booming bass music, drink and drug until 3am spring thru fall every night, leaving a mess behind for others to clean up. Our windows vibrate!  Occasionally the police clear them out but they are back within the hour. You have to call 911 to get a car dispatched and it is a very low priority. Perhaps the city could install a gate at Atwater and West Jefferson and at Atwater and Civic Center drive that closes the street at 10pm when the park closes, except for special events at Cobo and the Joe.
